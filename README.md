# ChaoticFractalZoo

•Rendered fractals in 2 and 3 dimensions using affine transformations and the chaos game algorithm

•Efficiently plotted escape-time-fractals with perturbation theory, series approximations, and glitch auto-correction

•Simulated flocking behavior using boids through a fractal 3d landscape rendered using ray marching
